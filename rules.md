### ELIGIBILITY

- Entry to the competition is free for all. By making a submission to the competition, the competitors agree to accept and abide by the rules set out in this challenge.
- Participants are free to decide whether they will enter the competition as sole competitors or form a team. A team can have at most 10 members. Teams should submit their predictions under a single account. A participant can be a member of only one team. The teams will be asked to provide the names of their participants.
- The challenge organizers, their employees and affiliates, employees from the same organization as the organizers, parents, agents, representatives, advertising and promotional agencies and members of the immediate family (parents, children or siblings) of these employees or any person with whom they are domiciled, are permitted to participate in the challenge, however, these teams should disclose this information before hand and they will not be eligible to win a monetary prize.

### DETERMINING WINNERS
- The challenge will have two separate leaderboards - a private and a public leaderboard. The former will rank the solutions on the complete test data set, and the potential winners will be determined solely by this ranking - available once the competition has ended. During the competition period, the current ranking will be visible on the public leaderboard, computed on a subset of the test data. The best performing solution of each competitor on the public leaderboard will be used for evaluating the private leaderboard and determining the winner.
- In the event of a tie, the organizers will determine the winner based on the proposed solution.
- In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the submission that received the next highest score on the private leaderboard will be chosen as the potential winner.

### WINNERS’ OBLIGATIONS
- The winning competitors should deliver to the organizers the final model's software code as used to generate the winning submission and associated documentation. The provided code of the competitors is expected to be reproducible and should produce the score from the leaderboard. The delivered software code should contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. This is a condition for being awarded a prize, failing to meet it leads to team disqualification and the prize is awarded to the next ranked team.
- The competitors agree that the organizers keep the right to use the names of the members of the winning teams when promoting the results of the competition through various outlets and media without any further compensation unless prohibited by law. The competitors give permission to the organizers to keep and store their contact details (name, e-mail, affiliation) for the purpose of further communication and sharing information related to the competition.

### PRIZES

- The winning solutions are eligible for a monetary prize if and only if their score is better than the baseline solution provided by the organizers at the beginning of the competition.
- The prizes are listed as gross amounts. The organizers will abide by the tax legislature of Slovenia (and the accompanying international conventions) in the matters related to processing the payments. The prizes for each team will be transferred to a single physical person - a team member designated by the team.

### SUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS
- By submitting predictions to the competition, the competitors accept that the code used to make the predictions (i.e., learning method, obtained model) will be released under a permissive Open-Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org). This condition must be met in order for a submission to be included in the final leaderboard.
- Should competitors build upon code from sources that are not their property, they are required to clearly attribute the sources. In the cases where this is not respected, this constitutes a law and an ethical violation and will lead to disqualification of the team.
- By acquiring the data or by accessing it in any manner, the competitors agree not to redistribute and share the data, and that they will use it solely for the purpose of non-commercial and academic-research.
- The competitors are permitted to publicly share competition code during the competition, provided that such sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on the platforms discussion forum as links to notebooks and code snipers associated specifically with the competition for the benefit of the competitors. By sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under a permissive Open-Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.
